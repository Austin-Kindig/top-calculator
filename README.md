This is a basic web-based calculator.

The point of this project is to act as a sort of captone for the
first js basics section of the Odin Project.

As with all my beginner projects, I hope to revisit this caculator
to increase the quality and number of features.

planned features:

1. keypad support
2. "working" aux display for easier workflow
3. scientific operations?
